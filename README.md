# Finite-Difference-for-Laplace-Equation
该程序使用Python编写，旨在使用有限差分法解决拉普拉斯方程。它将求解区域划分为差分网格，并使用有限数量的网格点来代替连续的求解域。程序将待求解的流动变量存储在每个网格点上，并使用差商来代替偏微分方程中的微分项，从而将偏微分方程转化为包含离散点上有限个未知变量的代数形式的差分方程组。通过求解该差分方程组，可以得到网格点上流动变量的数值解。代码中详细注释解释了每个步骤的目的和实现方法，以帮助更好地理解程序的功能和运行过程。此外，该程序具有灵活性，可以根据具体需求选择不同的函数形式并调整拟合的精度。

The program is written in Python and aims to solve the Laplace equation using the finite difference method. It divides the solution domain into a grid of discrete points, replacing the continuous domain with a finite number of grid points. The program stores the unknown flow variables at each grid point and replaces the differential terms in the partial differential equation with the corresponding finite difference approximations, thus transforming the partial differential equation into a system of algebraic difference equations involving a finite number of unknowns at discrete points. By solving this system of difference equations, numerical solutions for the flow variables at the grid points are obtained. The code includes detailed comments explaining the purpose and implementation of each step, facilitating a better understanding of the program's functionality and execution process. Additionally, the program offers flexibility to choose different function forms and adjust the accuracy of the solution based on specific requirements.
